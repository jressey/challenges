Summary
The purpose of these questions is for the test automation team to gain insight into how you write and test code. As such, include all source code with your answers and be sure to follow the best practices, patterns, and maintainability aspects of software engineering.  Be as thorough as you can. 
Be aware that the questions may or may not be complete in their requirements. Feel free to add additional requirements as needed to solve the problem.
Question 1
Write a method that answers the following problem:
Accept as input:
·       list: a singly-linked list
Remove the middle element of the list without iterating the list more than once.  Assume the list size cannot be known until traversed.
Support your answer with tests.
Question 2
Write a method that answers the following problem:
Accept as input:
·       list: an unordered list of arrays each with 4 elements.
·       target: an integer
Find and display the complete array that contains the provided target number. 
Question 3
Assume a database with the following structure:
Members  
ID
NAME 
ADDRESS
PHONE NUMBER
AGE
 Organization  
ID
MEMBER_ID
LOCATION
DUES
 
1.     Write a query that lists each member name, address, dues and location.
2.     Write a SQL Query to pull all members that are over 45
3.     Write a SQL Query to pull all members that have a dues value of 0.
